# Tank_Game
Tank Game project to start working smoothly with Unity.

Focus use of Raycast, changing scenes and Unity Editor's use.

### How to play

- **W/S** -> Move fordward and backwards
- **A/D** -> Rotates left or right side
- **Left Click** -> Shoot where canon is pointing
- **Right Click _(on enemy)_** -> Rotates canon to enemy targeted

Those are the basics controls that you have on this game. In a future there will be added new features.

Thanks for playing!
